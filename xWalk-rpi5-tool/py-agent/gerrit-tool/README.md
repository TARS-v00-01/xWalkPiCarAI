# Gerrit installer

This directory provides the non-root Gerrit installer for the college server.
Run it as the normal Linux user. Applications and controls remain below
`$HOME`; the Gerrit site may use a validated administrator-provided disk. The
installer does not use `sudo`, a system package manager, a system service, or a
network tunnel.

## Installer layout

- `shell-script/gerrit-setup.sh`: installer entry point;
- `shell-script/gerrit-storage-check.sh`: reversible storage validation entry point;
- `py-src/xWalkGerritServerSetup.py`: assessment and installation logic;
- `bin/`: management commands installed into `$HOME/bin`;
- `config/gerrit-setup.conf`: Gerrit installer configuration;
- `local-linux/`: separate configuration and entry point for the current Linux host;
- `../../../devloper-note/gerrit-note/Doc/note/`: configuration guides rendered into the site;
- `py-test/`: installer and component host tests.

## Required configuration

The current integrated uplift and synchronization workflow is documented in
[`Integrated Uplift Workflow.md`](../../../devloper-note/gerrit-note/Doc/note/Integrated%20Uplift%20Workflow.md).
It defines the ten
component mappings, complete CI gate, current-patch-set submission checks, service-account boundaries, audit log,
retries, recovery, and remaining administrator activation steps.

Edit `config/gerrit-setup.conf` before installation:

```bash
export EDUVPN_SERVER_IP="SERVER_IP_FROM_ASSESSMENT"
export GERRIT_STORAGE_PATH=""
export GERRIT_SERVER_HOST="$EDUVPN_SERVER_IP"
export GERRIT_SHA256="OFFICIAL_GERRIT_WAR_SHA256"
export GERRIT_ADMIN_USER="joxy"
export GERRIT_ADMIN_NAME="Joxy John"
export GERRIT_ADMIN_ROLE="Student"
export GERRIT_ADMIN_EMAIL="joxjoh24@student.hh.se"
export GERRIT_PROJECT="xWalkPiCarAI"
export GERRIT_BRANCH="master"
export GERRIT_VERIFICATION_TARGETS="xWalkPiCarAI:master,DevloperNote:master,xWalkAgent:master,xWalkAudioResources:master,xWalkController:master,xWalkHal:master,xWalk-rpi5-iw:master,xWalkLibrary:master,xWalk-rpi5-tool:master,xWalkTrace:master"
export GERRIT_HTTPS_PORT="18443"
export GERRIT_SSH_PORT="29418"
export GERRIT_HTTP_PORT="8080"
export GERRIT_HTTP_LISTEN_URL="proxy-https://127.0.0.1:${GERRIT_HTTP_PORT}/"
export GERRIT_CANONICAL_WEB_URL="https://${GERRIT_SERVER_HOST}:${GERRIT_HTTPS_PORT}/"
export GERRIT_SSH_LISTEN_ADDRESS="${GERRIT_SERVER_HOST}:${GERRIT_SSH_PORT}"
```

Replace the first two placeholders with:

- the assigned college-server IPv4 address reachable through eduVPN;
- the official Gerrit WAR SHA-256 checksum.

Change the administrator, project, branch, or ports in the same file when the
deployment requires different values. The installer prompts separately for a
unique administrator password of at least 12 characters.

`GERRIT_PROJECT` and `GERRIT_BRANCH` identify the primary CI target.
`GITHUB_SYNC_SOURCE_PROJECT` and `GITHUB_SYNC_SOURCE_BRANCH` select the exact
integrated Gerrit branch whose merge event may be synchronized. The supported
migration pairs are `xWalkPiCarAI/master` and `xWalk-rpi5-hw/master`; the GitHub
repository name and target branch must match the selected pair.
`GERRIT_VERIFICATION_TARGETS` is a
comma-separated allowlist of exact `project:branch` pairs whose active patch
sets receive host verification. Retain `xWalkPiCarAI:master` while it remains
the active integrated monorepository.

Every Gerrit code repository uses `master` as its default and review branch.
Each repository defines explicit Code-Review, Verified, and unresolved-comment
submit requirements. The review-controls plugin shows Submit only when Gerrit
reports the current patch set as submittable and both required votes pass.
Every component target uses a module-scoped Host Quality flow. CI checks out the integration baseline,
initializes exact pinned dependencies when required, and overlays the reviewed patch set at its approved path.
The graph contains only Preparation, that component's checks, and the Host Quality Gate; unrelated modules do
not run.

The `xWalk-rpi5-tool:master` target checks out the independent tool repository directly. It runs the Gerrit Python
tests, review-control tests, ShellCheck, and repository formatting validation without running hardware tests.
The documentation-template integration test runs when the adjacent `devloper-note` checkout is available; the
standalone tool review skips that cross-repository assertion, which remains covered by integrated CI.

During a repository-layout migration only, `GERRIT_INTEGRATION_BASELINE_REF` may select one exact
`refs/changes/NN/CHANGE/PATCH_SET` ref from the configured integration project. Component overlays then use that
reviewed layout instead of submitted `master`. Restore the value to `master` immediately after the new integration
layout is submitted. Arbitrary branches and symbolic refs are rejected.

After a component change passes its module-scoped Host Quality gate and is submitted, the event worker
automatically uploads the required `xWalkPiCarAI` integration review. The integration review runs the complete
graph. After that exact verified integration
patch set is submitted, the guarded synchronization service fast-forwards the configured GitHub branch to
Gerrit's resulting revision. This supports both fast-forward submissions and Gerrit-created merge commits.
Developers do not create a second manual component implementation commit for this chain.

`validate-publication-policy.sh` rejects GitHub push commands in workflows and all project-owned paths except the
guarded event worker and its Gerrit-verified synchronization helper. Source changes must always enter Gerrit through
`refs/for/master`; GitHub receives only the resulting submitted integration revision.

Sourcing the repository-root `xWalk-git-env.sh` also replaces every local GitHub push URL in the integration checkout
and its real gitlink submodules with a non-routable policy URL. Fetch URLs remain unchanged. The dedicated CI worker
does not use those developer remotes; it creates a temporary guarded GitHub remote only after validating the exact
submitted Gerrit event and CI vote.

The same environment configures a repository-local Gerrit push transport.
Before an ordinary `git push` opens Gerrit's SSH connection, the transport runs
the installed `$HOME/bin/gerrit-start` command when automatic startup is
enabled. The personal workstation therefore starts its local profile, while a
checkout on the college host starts the managed college profile. A machine
without an installed Gerrit server only connects to its configured remote
endpoint. The transport applies only to push URLs; fetch URLs and temporary CI
SSH commands remain unchanged.

Submitted component changes receive a separate `xWalk Integration Uplift`
change-log entry showing whether the integration review was uploaded. Submitted
integration changes receive a separate `xWalk GitHub Uplift` entry showing
`PASSED`, `FAILED`, or `SKIPPED` publication status. These entries use stable
autogenerated tags, notify the change owner and reviewers, and do not add new
Gerrit vote labels. Ordinary module-level CI change-log entries remain silent
to avoid notification noise. On service startup and after an event-stream
reconnect, the worker reconciles every component `master` tip through the
idempotent integration-uplift workflow. It also compares the configured Gerrit
and GitHub integration branch tips. A missed component merge event therefore
creates or finds its integration review, while a missed integrated merge event
runs the same guarded GitHub uplift. The worker then recovers active current
patch sets that have no `Verified` vote from the configured CI account. WIP
changes and patch sets with an existing CI success or failure remain untouched.
Existing per-change state markers and matching integration branch tips prevent
duplicate work.

The event-stream consumer never runs Host Quality inline. It dispatches the
exact patch set to a bounded worker pool without adding a transient queue
message to the Gerrit change log. Gerrit receives the start message only when
the worker begins verification, followed by the module results and final vote.
This keeps service recovery from duplicating queue messages. The service log
records queue acceptance. `GERRIT_CI_PATCHSET_WORKERS` controls the number of
concurrent patch sets and defaults to `2`; accepted values are `1` through `4`.
Duplicate events for the same repository, change, patch set, and revision are
suppressed while that job is queued or running.
Uploading a newer patch set cancels the older flow for that same repository and
change. The worker terminates the active check's process group, marks unfinished
dashboard nodes `CANCELLED`, does not vote on the superseded patch set, and
starts the newest patch set as soon as the shared integration lock is released.
Out-of-order events for older patch sets are ignored.
Complete integrated graphs additionally share one exclusive resource lock.
Component checks can run beside an integrated graph, but a second integrated
review remains queued until the first releases its build storage. Patch-set
checkouts live under `XWALK_CI_WORK_DIRECTORY`, which defaults to
`$HOME/gerrit-ci/work`; service startup removes interrupted `change-*`
workspaces from that dedicated directory before accepting new jobs.

Do not add the administrator password to the configuration file. The setup
script reads it without echo and exports `GERRIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` only to the
Python installer process. Do not place passwords, private keys, or tokens in
this repository.

## Gerrit storage

Leave `GERRIT_STORAGE_PATH` empty to use `$HOME/gerrit-site`. For a persistent
shared disk, set the absolute site path supplied by the administrator:

```bash
export GERRIT_STORAGE_PATH="/path/provided/by/administrator"
```

Validate it before installation:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/shell-script/gerrit-storage-check.sh
```

The check prints the resolved path and verifies its mount, ownership,
permissions, file locking, directory creation, read/write/remove operations,
and free space. It rejects symbolic escapes and broad paths. Only the college
account running Gerrit manages the site. Partners use Gerrit web and SSH and
must never modify `$GERRIT_SITE/git`, `db`, `index`, `data`, `cache`, or `etc`
directly. Never run two Gerrit processes against one site.

## Assess the server

Run the read-only assessment from the repository root:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/shell-script/gerrit-setup.sh assess
```

Confirm the persistent home filesystem, disk quota, Java compatibility,
physical network interface, selected server IP, and free ports. The default
ports are HTTPS `18443`, Gerrit SSH `29418`, and loopback HTTP `8080`.

## Install and start Gerrit

After updating `config/gerrit-setup.conf`, run:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/shell-script/gerrit-setup.sh install
```

The script prompts for the initial `joxy` password, exports it for the Python
installer, and removes it from its environment afterward. The installer
verifies downloads, initializes Gerrit on loopback, creates an initial backup,
configures HTTPS, binds Gerrit SSH to the selected address, starts Gerrit and
Caddy, starts CI when `$HOME/.xwalk-ci.env` is configured, and runs the
installation checks.

## Start an installed server

After a logout or server reboot, run:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/shell-script/gerrit-setup.sh start
```

This recovers any stopped Gerrit, HTTPS proxy, or configured CI process and
always runs `gerrit-check`. The same configured lifecycle applies to
`$HOME/bin/gerrit-start`, `gerrit-status`, `gerrit-stop`, and
`gerrit-restart`. A CI startup failure rolls back Gerrit and Caddy processes
started by the same command without stopping processes that were already
running. With the `systemd` process manager, the first configured start also
enables a user-level path unit for Gerrit's PID file. Later direct Gerrit
daemon starts therefore start `xwalk-gerrit-ci.service` automatically. The
autostart supervisor remains active with Gerrit and stops CI after Gerrit's
PID file disappears.

## Download button

The installer adds Gerrit's official `download-commands` plugin and configures
the change **Download** button for SSH and authenticated HTTP. After signing in,
select the required protocol and copy one of these generated options:

- **Checkout**: `git fetch` followed by `git checkout FETCH_HEAD`;
- **Cherry Pick**: `git fetch` followed by `git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD`;
- **Clone**: clone the project through SSH or authenticated HTTPS;
- **Patch File → Zip**: download the selected patch set as a zipped patch.

Gerrit replaces the example change ref below with the selected patch set's real
`refs/changes/...` value:

```bash
CHANGE_REF='refs/changes/NN/CHANGE_NUMBER/PATCH_SET'
```

```bash
git fetch ssh://USERNAME@SERVER_IP:SSH_PORT/PROJECT "$CHANGE_REF"
```

```bash
git checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

For an SSH cherry pick, fetch the selected patch set again and apply it:

```bash
git fetch ssh://USERNAME@SERVER_IP:SSH_PORT/PROJECT "$CHANGE_REF"
```

```bash
git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
```

```bash
git clone ssh://USERNAME@SERVER_IP:SSH_PORT/PROJECT
```

```bash
git push ssh://USERNAME@SERVER_IP:SSH_PORT/PROJECT HEAD:refs/for/BRANCH
```

```bash
git fetch https://USERNAME@SERVER_IP:HTTPS_PORT/PROJECT "$CHANGE_REF"
```

```bash
git checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

For an HTTPS cherry pick, fetch the selected patch set again and apply it:

```bash
git fetch https://USERNAME@SERVER_IP:HTTPS_PORT/PROJECT "$CHANGE_REF"
```

```bash
git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
```

```bash
git clone https://USERNAME@SERVER_IP:HTTPS_PORT/PROJECT
```

```bash
git push https://USERNAME@SERVER_IP:HTTPS_PORT/PROJECT HEAD:refs/for/BRANCH
```

HTTPS commands prompt for the user's individual password. Never embed the
password in a URL or disable TLS certificate verification. Both push commands
upload a change for review; they do not push directly to the protected branch.

## Installed paths

| Content | Installed path |
|---|---|
| Gerrit application | `$HOME/apps/gerrit` |
| Gerrit site | `$GERRIT_STORAGE_PATH`, or `$HOME/gerrit-site` when empty |
| Authoritative repositories | `$GERRIT_SITE/git` |
| Caddy application | `$HOME/apps/caddy` |
| Caddy configuration | `$HOME/gerrit-proxy` |
| Management commands | `$HOME/bin` |
| Rendered guides | `$GERRIT_SITE/docs` |
| Backups | `$HOME/backups/gerrit` |

Print the installed HTTPS address with:

```bash
git config --file "$GERRIT_SITE/etc/gerrit.config" --get gerrit.canonicalWebUrl
```

Continue with `$GERRIT_SITE/docs/Gerrit Admin Setup.md`
after the installer completes.

## Local Gerrit

The `local-linux` profile provides a separate Gerrit deployment for the current
Linux computer. It reuses the non-root installer but does not reuse the college
server configuration. Its configuration is stored in
`local-linux/gerrit-local.conf`.

For the assessed local host, configure:

- web review: `https://GERRIT_SERVER_HOST:GERRIT_HTTPS_PORT/`;
- Gerrit SSH: `GERRIT_SERVER_HOST:GERRIT_SSH_PORT`;
- project: `xWalk-rpi5-hw`;
- review branch: `master`.

Assess, install, and later restart the local instance with:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/local-linux/gerrit-local.sh assess
```

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/local-linux/gerrit-local.sh install
```

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/local-linux/gerrit-local.sh start
```

Reassess the host and update `GERRIT_SERVER_IP` if its Wi-Fi or Ethernet address
changes. The local Gerrit **Download** button provides separate SSH and HTTPS
commands for clone, fetch and checkout, fetch and cherry-pick, and push for
review. It also provides a zipped patch file.

See [`local-linux/README.md`](local-linux/README.md) for the exact local Git
commands and
[`Gerrit Local Linux Setup.md`](../../../devloper-note/gerrit-note/Doc/note/Gerrit%20Local%20Linux%20Setup.md)
for the administrator workflow and deployment limitations.

## Multi-repository migration

The guarded multi-repository tools use `config/multi-repo.conf`. They prepare
ten component repositories and the private `xWalk-rpi5-hw` integration repository.
They never create component repositories on GitHub, edit Gerrit's internal Git
directories, force-push the source monorepo, or convert this working tree in
place.

Review a complete provisioning and ACL plan:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/shell-script/gerrit-multi-repo-provision.sh --dry-run
```

Prepare history-preserving component repositories in a new directory:

```bash
export XWALK_SPLIT_OUTPUT_DIR="/safe/new/output"
```

```bash
export XWALK_CONFIRM_SPLIT="SPLIT_COMPONENT_HISTORY"
```

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/shell-script/gerrit-history-split.sh --apply
```

The default `XWALK_IMPORT_MODE=none` performs no remote push. Select `review`
for `refs/for/master` or `direct` only when the administrator has authorized the
initial `refs/heads/master` import, then separately set
`XWALK_CONFIRM_IMPORT=PUSH_COMPONENTS_TO_GERRIT`.

Prepare a separate integration clone containing exact Gerrit gitlinks:

```bash
export XWALK_INTEGRATION_OUTPUT_DIR="/safe/new/xWalk-rpi5-hw"
```

```bash
export XWALK_CONFIRM_SUBMODULES="CREATE_INTEGRATION_CLONE"
```

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/shell-script/gerrit-submodule-migrate.sh --apply
```

Plan one coordinated uplift for submitted changes sharing a Gerrit topic:

```bash
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/gerrit-tool/shell-script/gerrit-topic-uplift.sh --dry-run TOPIC xWalkLibrary FULL_COMMIT CHANGE xWalkHal FULL_COMMIT CHANGE
```

Normal module upload:

```bash
cd xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal
```

```bash
git switch master
```

```bash
git pull --ff-only origin master
```

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -s -m "Update HAL implementation"
```

```bash
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
```

Existing integration clones synchronize exact recorded revisions with:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

```bash
git submodule sync --recursive
```

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Source changes are recorded in Gerrit commit messages and review history. CI
votes and synchronization results are posted directly to the affected Gerrit
change. No CSV or Markdown operation logs are created. See
[architecture guide](../../../devloper-note/gerrit-note/Doc/note/Gerrit%20Multi%20Repository%20Architecture.md)
before applying provisioning, ACL, migration, uplift, or GitHub synchronization.
