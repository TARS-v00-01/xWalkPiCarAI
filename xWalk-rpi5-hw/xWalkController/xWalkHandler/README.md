# xWalkHandler

`xWalkHandler` owns the hardware-independent `XWalkController` contract,
command-text conversion, callback boundary, and command-handler implementations
used by the standalone CLI. Application-level command dispatch is owned by the
sibling `xWalkApp` directory.

All Controller-owned classes, request DTOs, callbacks, and command functions
use `namespace xwalk::ctrl`. Existing Agent coordinators remain in the
parent `xwalk::agent` namespace. Inside the nested Controller namespace, shared
primitive aliases use the explicit global form `::ctrl::*` to avoid namespace
shadowing.

The handler stores non-owning pointers to caller-owned Agent coordinators and a
copied callback table. Its in-memory host test remains beside the implementation.
Application entry points, generated-help resources, and application GoogleTest
remain in the sibling `xWalkApp` directory. Its `CMakeLists.txt` file
compiles these sources without changing the public target name or runtime
behavior.

## Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `include/xController.h` | Controller contract and command handlers |
| `include/xControllerHelp.h` | Generated-help selection and source fallback |
| `include/xControllerTypes.h` | Platform callback, option, and sound types |
| `src/xControllerLifecycle.cpp` | Dependency binding and callback forwarding |
| `src/common/` | Shared cancellation and command-safety support |
| `src/vehicle/` | Movement, sensing, line-tracking, and self-drive handlers |
| `src/vision/` | Camera, detection, tracking, and video handlers |
| `src/voice/` | Voice, language-model, and storytelling handlers |
| `src/media/` | Sound and background-music handlers |
| `src/connectivity/` | Mobile-app and SPI handlers |
| `src/calibration/` | Servo-zeroing, calibration, and verification handlers |
| `src/platform/` | Passive platform-diagnostic handlers |
| `test/src/xControllerTest.cpp` | Deterministic in-memory command-handler verification |

Command handlers use the requested
`XWALK_handler<CommandOrModuleName>` member-function convention. Public header
basenames remain unchanged, so consumers continue to include
`xController.h` through the CMake target's public include path.
Every `XWALK_handler...` member has one dedicated source file. Functionality
directories express the owning command domain; shared non-handler methods stay
in the root or the `common` and calibration-support sources. The application
free functions are declared and implemented under `../xWalkApp`.

CLI text is accepted only by the free parsing boundary in sibling `xWalkApp`.
Before dispatch, it is
converted into the command-specific enums and plain request structures declared
in `xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkLibrary/common/include/xWalkControllerConfigTypes.h`. Handlers receive
typed actions, numeric values with explicit units, paths, byte payloads, and
flags; they do not index or interpret a `ctrl::stringvector`. Commands with no
payload receive `XWalkNoArgumentRequest`, and commands whose only value is
`start` or `stop` share `XWalkLifecycleRequest`.

Bounded forward and backward movement refreshes the requested motor output
on a 250-millisecond monotonic schedule while retaining the shared cancellable-delay polling.
Absolute deadlines prevent scheduling and backend overhead from extending the requested duration.
Every bounded exit stops both motors, and a zero-duration request never
energizes them. The separate movement demo retains its existing sequence.

`calibration/xControllerCalibrationSupport.cpp` contains only the
shared calibration steps used by the dedicated calibration handlers. It does
not define another command handler. PiCar-X command selection is an
application-owned free function declared and implemented in the sibling
`xWalkApp` directory.

## Trace reporting

Command handlers do not use the Controller output callback for status,
results, warnings, or failures. Normal handler records use a unique
`XWALK_CTRL_TRACE_UIDn` identifier, recoverable failures use
`XWALK_CTRL_ERROR` with `XWALK_EXCEPTION`, and warnings use
`XWALK_CTRL_WARNING`. Throwing failures use `XWALK_CTRL_ERROR` with the
appropriate short C++ selector. The output callback remains available at the
application boundary for
help text and to Agent workflows whose public interaction contract requires
conversation output.

## Build and host verification

Build and test through the owning controller aggregate:

```bash
cmake -S xWalkController -B xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkController/build-host -DXWALK_CLI_BUILD_HOST=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkController/build-host --parallel
ctest --test-dir xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkController/build-host --output-on-failure
```

These commands are host-only. Physical Raspberry Pi behavior remains opt-in;
see the [application guide](../xWalkApp/README.md) for hardware
build discovery and command safety requirements.
