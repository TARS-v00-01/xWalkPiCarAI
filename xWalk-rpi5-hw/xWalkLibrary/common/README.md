# xWalk common library

Workspace-level C++17 declarations and standard-library includes shared by
xWalk HAL, agent, CLI, and future application modules.

The public headers are stored under `include/`, while the CMake interface
definition remains in this directory. The `xWalkLibraryCommon` interface target
exports the include directory so consumers continue to include headers by
basename and link the stable `xWalkLibraryCommon` target.

Public header:

```cpp
#include "xHal_Rpi5CarCommon.h"
```

Reusable non-member production functions are declared in:

```cpp
#include "xHal_Rpi5CarCommonFunctions.h"
```

They live in `namespace xwalk::hal::common`. Module source files call these
functions with the `common::` qualifier instead of defining anonymous or
module-local free helper functions. Class-specific behavior remains a class
method in its owning module.

Reusable filesystem operations are declared separately in:

```cpp
#include "xHal_Rpi5CarFileFunctions.h"
```

These functions live directly in `namespace xwalk::hal`, matching types such as
`uint32`. Modules call `filesystemEntryExists()`, `filesystemStatus()`,
`replaceFilesystemPermissions()`, and the other wrappers instead of calling
`std::filesystem` operations directly. File-open modes, permission options, and
line extraction are exposed through typed constants and `readFileLine()`.
Complete binary reads use `readFileContents()`, and direct-child directory
enumeration uses `listFilesystemEntryNames()`.

All standard-library headers used by the HAL modules are centralized in:

```cpp
#include "xHal_Rpi5CarStandardHeaders.h"
```

Submodules include their project header and do not include standard-library
headers directly.

Host tests verify rejected operations without exception handlers through:

```cpp
#include "xHal_Rpi5CarTestFunctions.h"
```

`xwalk::hal::test::expectFailure()` runs the operation in an isolated Linux
child process and asserts that it does not complete successfully.

Project namespace and shared data-type definitions are declared in:

```cpp
#include "xHal_Rpi5CarTypes.h"
```

The common type vocabulary includes aliases for standard-library data types
used outside the common boundary. These include containers, exceptions,
streams, filesystem paths and metadata, file-open modes, permission options,
synchronization objects, and error codes. Modules use aliases such as
`stringvector`, `logicerror`, `filesystempath`, `outputfilestream`,
`fileopenmode`, and `errorcode` instead of spelling the underlying standard type
directly. Standard-library qualification remains inside the common boundary.

Shared Agent composition parameters and the boot-application callback are
declared in:

```cpp
#include "xWalk_Rpi5CarAgentConfigType.h"
```

`xAgentContext` groups non-owning application, configuration, PiCar-X HAL,
vehicle, I2C, and GPIO dependencies for synchronous Agent composition without
transferring resource ownership into the common library. PiCar-X construction
uses the `motors`, `dirServo`, `panServo`, `tiltServo`, `grayscale`,
`ultrasonic`, and `config` fields.

Generic aliases are exported into three layer-specific namespaces:

| Layer | Full namespace | Concise namespace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HAL | `xwalk::hal` | `hal` |
| Agent | `xwalk::agent` | `agent` |
| Controller | `xwalk::controller` | `ctrl` |

Each layer qualifies shared types through its own concise namespace. HAL-only
classes, callbacks, and sensor-specific structures remain exclusively under
`xwalk::hal` and are not re-exported as Controller or Agent types.

The typed top-level Controller command request macros have their own focused header:

```cpp
#include "xControllerCommand.h"
```

`xWalkControllerConfigTypes.h` includes this header for the command request
DTO, while parsing and routing code may include it directly when no request
structure is required.

Standard exception types are exposed through the documented aliases in
`xHal_Rpi5CarTypes.h`. Traced call sites use the stable signals declared by
`xHal_Rpi5CarErrorSignals.h` and pass the signal with a message to their
component `ERROR` macro. That macro records the diagnostic and throws the
selected signal's exception type. The header-only common library throws aliases
directly without a trace because xWalkTrace itself depends on this foundational
target. xWalkTrace also throws aliases directly for its own failures to avoid
recursive tracing.

Linux system headers needed only by optional hardware backends are centralized
in `xHal_Rpi5CarLinuxHeaders.h`. Host-only HAL sources do not include this
header.

Reusable context-to-backend I2C callback bridges include
`XHAL_I2C_PROBE_CALLBACK`, `XHAL_I2C_WRITE_REGISTER_CALLBACK`,
`XHAL_I2C_READ_CALLBACK`, and `XHAL_I2C_READ_REGISTER_CALLBACK` in
`xHal_Rpi5CarCommon.h`. Hardware backends bind these macros to their public
device-operation methods.

Standard math operations are exposed as uppercase function-like macros in
`xHal_Rpi5CarMath.h`. Submodules use these macros and contain no direct `std::`
references. Power and sine calculations use `XHAL_POWER` and `XHAL_SINE`.

The `xWalkLibraryCommon` CMake target is a header-only interface library. Linking it
propagates the common include directory and the C++17 requirement.

Shared hardware constants use uppercase, project-prefixed macros. PWM register
and clock definitions use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_PWM_` prefix. Servo angle, pulse,
frame, frequency, and period definitions use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_SERVO_` prefix
and include units in their names. Ultrasonic sound-speed, timing, attempt, and
status-result definitions use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_ULTRASONIC_` prefix and remain
in `xHal_Rpi5CarCommon.h` rather than the sensor module header.
Line-tracker channel, threshold, adaptive-reference, weighting, position, and
rounding definitions use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_LINE_TRACKER_` prefix in the same
shared header.
ADXL345 address, register, axis, sample-size, sign, and scaling definitions use
the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_ADXL345_` prefix in that shared header.
RGB LED channel indices, connection selectors, packed-color masks, shifts, and
conversion scales use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_RGB_LED_` prefix in that shared header.
Buzzer duty-cycle and playback-duration conversion definitions use the
`XHAL_RPI5CAR_BUZZER_` prefix in that shared header.
LED blink-count, transition timing, duration conversion, and worker polling
definitions use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_LED_` prefix in that shared header.
User-button active level, polling interval, long-press limits, and timing
conversion definitions use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_USER_BUTTON_` prefix.
Music PCM format, theory, MIDI range, volume, rounding, and compatibility
definitions use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_MUSIC_` prefix.
Speaker task-count, chunk-size, pause-polling, and invalid-slot definitions use
the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_SPEAKER_` prefix.
Device-tree root, node, property, UUID, board-pin, motor-mode, and hexadecimal
limits use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_DEVICE_` prefix.
Utility volume limits, lazy-reader timing, and millisecond conversion definitions
use the `XHAL_RPI5CAR_UTILS_` prefix.

## Clean the build

Run these commands from the repository root. When the common library is built
separately, remove only the compiled outputs while keeping its configuration:

```bash
cmake --build xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkLibrary/common/build --target clean
```

For a completely clean configure, remove the entire generated build directory:

```bash
cmake -E remove_directory xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkLibrary/common/build
```

The `xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkLibrary/common` headers, `CMakeLists.txt`, and README source files are
not removed.
After a full clean, configure and build again with:

```bash
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkLibrary/common -B xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkLibrary/common/build
cmake --build xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkLibrary/common/build --parallel
```
