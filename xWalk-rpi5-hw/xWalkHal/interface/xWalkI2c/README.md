| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `core/include` | Hardware-independent I2C public contract |
| `core/src` | Callback forwarding, validation, and lifecycle behavior |
| `simulation/include` | Arguments, operation handler, host mirror, and runner configuration |
| `simulation/src` | Standalone runner, argument parsing, operation handler, and host mirror implementation |
| `test/include` | Google Test fixture declaration and owned test dependencies |
| `test/src` | Individual Google Tests for public I2C operations |
| `hardware/include` | Linux I2C backend and injectable device-operation contracts |
| `hardware/src` | Linux `i2c-dev` ownership and callback operations |
| `hardware/test/src` | Opt-in physical-device probe test |

`XWalkI2c` is intentionally independent of Raspberry Pi hardware. It is a
concrete non-virtual object containing C-style callback pointers and a context
pointer. Host tests execute the Linux backend with a mirrored device boundary. The optional
`XWalkI2cLinux` backend supplies callback-compatible operations implemented with
Linux `i2c-dev`.

Core, Linux, host-stub, and simulation-factory operations use `xWalkTrace`.
Forty-two filtered identifiers from `RPI.001` through `RPI.042` describe lifecycle and
transaction progress. Warnings and errors bypass UID filtering, and numeric
HAL assertion signals identify failed validation, exhausted retries,
hardware-test failures, and host-test checks. The diagnostic assertion macro
records a signal; normal exception and C++ assertion behavior remains
responsible for control flow.

The simulation generates a module-local trace configuration from the scanner
inventory. It enables all four priorities and every trace originating below
`xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c/`, while traces from other modules remain disabled.

The standalone simulation `main()` explicitly boots the global trace service,
constructs the build-selected device backend, and dispatches
`XWalkI2cHandler`. It does not include or invoke Google Test code. CMake supplies
the generated configuration and build-local log paths.

The host entry point creates both `XWalkI2cLinux` and `XWalkI2cHostStub`.
`XWalkI2c` binds to the real Linux backend through the same `XHAL_I2C_*_CALLBACK`
macros used on Raspberry Pi. The backend then calls the injected
`XWalkI2cDevice`; the host stub mirrors only device open, address
selection, SMBus transfer, and close operations. This executes core validation,
Linux retry logic, and Linux transaction encoding without physical hardware.

Composition is explicit at the application or test entry point: construct the
backend first, construct a separate `XWalkI2c` with a non-owning pointer to that
backend, then pass the I2C object by reference to consumers. The Linux backend
does not contain or own an `XWalkI2c` object. It also supplies the optional
non-throwing safe-write callback used by actuator cleanup. `tryWriteRegister()`
returns a Boolean status for invalid input, a missing safe callback, or backend
write failure; it does not intercept an exception.

## Build xWalkI2c separately

The module can be configured and built directly without building `xWalkPwm`
and without Raspberry Pi hardware. Its CMake configuration automatically adds
the adjacent `xWalkLibraryCommon` and `xWalkTrace` dependencies.

Run these commands from the repository root:

The host test is a Linux-backend simulation. It builds and executes
`XWalkI2cLinux`, but its injected device interface never opens `/dev/i2c-1` and
does not require an RPi.

```bash
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c -B xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c/build-host -DXWALK_I2C_BUILD_HOST_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build xWalkI2c/build-host --parallel
```

| CMake flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `XWALK_I2C_BUILD_HOST_TESTS` | `OFF` | Build Linux-backend simulation tests without hardware |
| `XWALK_I2C_BUILD_HARDWARE_TESTS` | `OFF` | Build the Linux backend and RPi integration test |

## Run the standalone simulation

The default build uses the device-free stub while executing the same public
core and Linux-backend operations as the hardware selection. Run the following
commands from `xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c/simulation`:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-simulation -DXWALK_I2C_SIMULATION_BACKEND=stub
cmake --build build-simulation --target xWalkI2cSimulation --parallel
./build-simulation/xWalkI2cSimulation
```

The hardware selection compiles the same `main()` and handler with the hardware
device factory. Running it performs real I2C reads and writes and is therefore
opt-in:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-hardware -DXWALK_I2C_SIMULATION_BACKEND=hardware -DXWALK_I2C_SIMULATION_DEVICE=/dev/i2c-1
cmake --build build-hardware --target xWalkI2cSimulation --parallel
```

After confirming that the correct Raspberry Pi and Robot HAT setup is connected
and safe, the hardware binary accepts one optional trace selector:

```bash
./build-hardware/xWalkI2cSimulation --help
./build-hardware/xWalkI2cSimulation --trace RPI.031.enable
./build-hardware/xWalkI2cSimulation --trace RPI.031.disable
./build-hardware/xWalkI2cSimulation --trace all.enable
./build-hardware/xWalkI2cSimulation --trace all.disable
```

Tracing is enabled by default. Invalid syntax and scanner-unknown UIDs return
status `2` before the hardware device is opened.
Help reports the accepted selector forms and compile-time trace-ID uniqueness
requirement without configuring tracing or opening hardware.

The resulting libraries are:

| Library | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `xWalkI2c/build-host/libxWalkI2c.a` | Hardware-independent I2C callback object |
| `xWalkI2c/build-host/xWalkTrace/libxWalkTrace.a` | Shared filtered and unfiltered diagnostics |

`xWalkLibraryCommon` is a header-only interface target, so it propagates shared types,
math operations, and exception helpers without producing a separate archive.
`xWalkTrace` uses the generated XML inventory and is linked into I2C executables
through the module target.

To build the library without its host test:

```bash
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c -B xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c/build-lib -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build xWalkI2c/build-lib --parallel
```

## Test xWalkI2c separately

After configuring with `XWALK_I2C_BUILD_HOST_TESTS=ON`, run the test through CTest:

```bash
ctest --test-dir xWalkI2c/build-host --output-on-failure
```

The test executable can also be run directly:

```bash
./xWalkI2c/build-host/xWalkI2cTest
```

Seven individual Google Test cases verify address probing, probe validation,
register writes, fail-safe writes, sequential reads, register-addressed reads,
and missing register-read callback validation. Five additional cases validate
default, help, individual, all-trace, and malformed simulation arguments. They use
the injected device mirror and do not access `/dev/i2c-*` or require an RPi.

| Expected result | Value |
|---|---|
| CTest name | `xWalkI2cHostTest` |
| Google Test cases | `12` |
| Required hardware | None |
| Required sibling modules | `xWalkLibraryCommon`, `xWalkTrace` |
| Expected passing CTest entries | `1` |

## Test on Raspberry Pi hardware

### Current hardware status

`XWalkI2c` remains the hardware-independent callback object. The prepared
`XWalkI2cLinux` backend owns the `/dev/i2c-1` file descriptor and supplies
Linux callback-compatible operations. The hardware-test entry point creates a
separate `XWalkI2c` object and binds its non-owning context to the backend. The
backend is compiled only when
`XWALK_I2C_BUILD_HARDWARE_TESTS=ON`.

The backend has been compiled on a Linux host but has not yet been validated
against physical Robot HAT hardware.

| Callback | Linux backend responsibility |
|---|---|
| `i2cprobecallback` | Select an address and report whether the device responds |
| `i2cwriteregistercallback` | Write a register followed by the supplied data bytes |
| `i2creadcallback` | Read a requested number of bytes from the selected device |
| `i2creadregistercallback` | Atomically select a register and read consecutive bytes |
| `i2ctrywriteregistercallback` | Attempt a validated register write and return status without throwing |

The backend uses Linux `i2c-dev` access without virtual functions and keeps the
Linux file descriptor outside `XWalkI2c`.

### Hardware information

| Item | Expected value |
|---|---|
| Linux I2C device | `/dev/i2c-1` |
| Bus number | `1` |
| Robot HAT addresses | `0x14`, `0x15`, `0x16` |
| Two-data-byte operation | SMBus word write |
| Larger operation | SMBus I2C block write |
| PWM value byte order | High byte followed by low byte |
| Retry count | `5` |

No additional SunFounder repository is required for the C++ Linux backend.
The hardware-specific requirements are the Robot HAT register protocol, its
firmware, and Linux I2C device access.

### Prepare and inspect the RPi

Enable I2C using the configuration method provided by the installed Raspberry
Pi OS, reboot if required, and confirm that bus 1 exists:

```bash
ls -l /dev/i2c-1
```

Scan bus 1 before running a write test:

```bash
i2cdetect -y 1
```

At least one of `14`, `15`, or `16` should appear in the scan. If none appears,
check power, cabling, I2C enablement, permissions, and Robot HAT firmware before
running any PWM test.

### Recommended hardware-test order

Keep the vehicle raised so its wheels cannot move unexpectedly. Begin with
read-only or zero-output operations.

| Order | Hardware test | Expected behavior |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Device-file test | `/dev/i2c-1` can be opened |
| 2 | Address-probe test | One expected Robot HAT address responds |
| 3 | Zero-output write | A selected PWM channel is written with value zero |
| 4 | Fixed PWM output | A known frequency and duty cycle are generated |
| 5 | Scope or logic-analyzer check | Frequency, duty cycle, and byte order match the request |
| 6 | Channel mapping | Physical outputs P0 through P19 use the expected timer groups |
| 7 | Repeated-write test | No intermittent I2C errors occur during extended operation |

### Build the prepared Linux backend

Hardware code and tests are disabled by default so normal host builds remain
portable and safe. The CMake interface provides this flag:

```cmake
option(XWALK_I2C_BUILD_HARDWARE_TESTS "Build RPi I2C hardware tests" OFF)
```

The backend can be compile-checked on a Linux host without running it:

```bash
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c -B xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c/build-rpi -DXWALK_I2C_BUILD_HARDWARE_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build xWalkI2c/build-rpi --parallel
```

This creates `libxWalkI2cLinux.a` and the
`xWalkI2cLinuxHardwareTest` executable. Do not run the executable on a machine
without `/dev/i2c-1` and a connected Robot HAT.

Set `XWALK_I2C_HARDWARE_DEVICE` during CMake configuration when the prepared
target uses another bus path. The selected path is passed to the hardware test;
the test does not scan or guess an I2C bus.

List the hardware-labelled test without running it:

```bash
ctest --test-dir xWalkI2c/build-rpi -N -L hardware
```

On the RPi with hardware connected, run only the hardware-labelled test:

```bash
ctest --test-dir xWalkI2c/build-rpi -L hardware --output-on-failure
```

The registered I2C hardware test is `xWalkI2cLinuxHardwareProbeTest`. It opens
`/dev/i2c-1` and succeeds only when one of `0x14`, `0x15`, or `0x16` responds.
The hardware configuration is rejected on non-Linux systems.

## Clean the xWalkI2c build

Run the following command from the repository root to remove simulated host-test
outputs while retaining the CMake cache:

```bash
cmake --build xWalkI2c/build-host --target clean
```

To remove the simulation configuration and every generated file, delete its
complete build directory through CMake:

```bash
cmake -E remove_directory xWalkI2c/build-host
```

Use separate commands for the hardware and library-only build directories:

```bash
cmake -E remove_directory xWalkI2c/build-rpi
cmake -E remove_directory xWalkI2c/build-lib
```

These commands remove only generated build directories. They do not remove
`core`, `hardware`, `test`, `CMakeLists.txt`, or the workspace module `../../../xWalkLibrary/common`
source directory.

Perform a clean rebuild and rerun the host test with:

```bash
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c -B xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/interface/xWalkI2c/build-host -DXWALK_I2C_BUILD_HOST_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build xWalkI2c/build-host --parallel
ctest --test-dir xWalkI2c/build-host --output-on-failure
```
