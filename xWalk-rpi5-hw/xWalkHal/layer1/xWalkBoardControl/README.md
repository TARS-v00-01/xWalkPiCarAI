# xWalkBoardControl

C++17 embedded-oriented Robot HAT board-services module combining board control,
Linux device-tree discovery, and firmware-version reporting.

The module retains three focused classes:

- `XWalkBoardControl` coordinates MCU reset, battery sensing, GPIO output, and
  speaker-power sequencing through caller-owned hardware dependencies.
- `XWalkDevice` discovers Robot HAT information from a Linux firmware device tree.
- `XWalkFirmwareInfo` reads the Robot HAT firmware version through injected I2C.

Each class remains in separate headers and implementation files while all three
are provided by the single `xWalkBoardControl` static library.

Production operations and host verification use `RPI.321` through `RPI.338`.
IDs remain unique within the `RPI` tag, and the workspace metadata validator
rejects any repeated numeric ID within that tag.

## Composition and ownership

Create device discovery, Linux backends, GPIO interfaces, I2C, ADC, and board
control in `main()`. Device information selects the board-specific speaker GPIO
before `XWalkBoardControl` is constructed. Firmware information receives I2C by
reference and stores only a non-owning pointer.

```cpp
XWalkDevice device;
const XWalkDeviceInformation& deviceInformation = device.information();
XWalkFirmwareInfo firmwareInformation(i2c);
XWalkBoardControl boardControl(mcuResetGpio, speakerEnableGpio, batteryAdc,
    &audioBackend, &primeSpeakerOutput);
```

All injected GPIO, ADC, I2C, and callback contexts must outlive their consumers.
Direct dependency access requires external serialization.

## Board-control behavior

- MCU reset drives the reset line low and high using bounded delays.
- Battery acquisition reads ADC channel A4 and applies the hardware divider ratio.
- Speaker enable uses the board-specific active GPIO and a required prime callback.
- Speaker disable drives the selected power-control GPIO inactive.
- No shell command is used for GPIO or audio control.

## Device-discovery behavior

- Candidate direct-child device-tree node names must contain `hat`.
- Robot HAT v5 UUID `9daeea78-0000-076e-0032-582369ac3e02` is recognized.
- Product, vendor, identifier, version, and UUID properties are retained.
- Robot HAT v5 selects speaker GPIO 12 and motor mode 2.
- Missing supported UUIDs retain Robot HAT v4 defaults: GPIO 20 and motor mode 1.
- `refresh()` replaces prior information only after selected properties validate.

## Firmware-information behavior

- I2C address `0x14` is probed before `0x15`.
- Exactly three bytes are read from firmware register `0x05`.
- Major, minor, and patch components are represented as unsigned values.
- Firmware text uses `major.minor.patch` formatting.
- Robot HAT compatibility version `2.5.5` remains static metadata.

## Host build and tests

Reusable callback state and functions live in the named
`xwalk::hal::test::boardcontrol` support namespace. Scenario sources contain
only fixtures, assertions, and suite entry points.

```bash
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/layer1/xWalkBoardControl -B xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/layer1/xWalkBoardControl/build-host -DXWALK_BOARD_CONTROL_BUILD_HOST_TESTS=ON
cmake --build xWalkBoardControl/build-host --parallel
ctest --test-dir xWalkBoardControl/build-host --output-on-failure
```

Host tests use in-memory hardware backends and a synthetic device tree. They do
not access physical GPIO, I2C, audio, or `/proc/device-tree` resources.

## Trace persistence

The standalone simulation and host tests use a generated XML catalogue. A
selector such as `--trace RPI.330.enable` updates that XML atomically. Later
simulation runs load the saved state without requiring another flag. Enabled
records are written to both the terminal and the configured log file through
xWalk trace macros.

## Safe host simulation

The simulation uses named in-memory GPIO, I2C, ADC, firmware, and speaker-prime
adapters plus a build-local synthetic device tree. It does not access physical
GPIO, I2C, ALSA, or `/proc/device-tree` resources.

```bash
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/layer1/xWalkBoardControl/simulation -B build/xWalkBoardControl-simulation
cmake --build build/xWalkBoardControl-simulation --parallel
build/xWalkBoardControl-simulation/xWalkBoardControlSimulation
```

## Hardware compile and test discovery

```bash
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/layer1/xWalkBoardControl -B xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/layer1/xWalkBoardControl/build-rpi -DXWALK_BOARD_CONTROL_BUILD_HARDWARE_TESTS=ON
cmake --build xWalkBoardControl/build-rpi --parallel
ctest --test-dir xWalkBoardControl/build-rpi -N -L hardware
```

These commands compile and list the board-control, firmware-read, and read-only
device-discovery tests without executing them. Physical hardware tests require
the correct Robot HAT safety setup and must not be run during normal verification.
