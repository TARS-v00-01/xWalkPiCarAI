# xWalkVoiceAssistant

`xWalkVoiceAssistant` provides synchronous, backend-neutral speech and model orchestration.

The application creates `XWalkSpeechToText`, `XWalkLanguageModel`, and
`XWalkTextToSpeech` in `main()` and passes references to the coordinator. The
assistant stores non-owning pointers and owns no microphone, model, network,
camera, speaker, trigger, thread, or operating-system resource.

Core behavior, simulation, and host tests use unique trace IDs `RPI.370` through
`RPI.382`. The repository validator rejects repeated numeric IDs within `RPI`.
Trace messages report only lifecycle state and text lengths, never speech text,
prompts, model responses, captured audio, fixtures, or credentials.

## Completed backend composition

The application composition order is:

1. Create the shared `XWalkAudioAlsa` owner.
2. Create `XWalkSpeechToTextAlsa` with an application-selected recognizer, then
   create `XWalkSpeechToText` from its callbacks.
3. Create `XWalkLanguageModelOllama`, then create `XWalkLanguageModel` from its
   callbacks.
4. Create `XWalkTextToSpeechAlsa` with an application-selected synthesizer,
   then create `XWalkTextToSpeech` with caller-owned board control.
5. Create `XWalkVoiceAssistant` last so it is destroyed before every dependency.

The full-stack host test follows this order with injected ALSA operations, a
fake recognizer, fake Ollama transport, and fake synthesis. It verifies a
complete capture, recognition, model, synthesis, and playback round without
opening a device, contacting a model, or writing a file.

One round performs these operations:

1. Check speech-backend readiness and listen until its recognizer reports an
   utterance endpoint or the configured hard timeout is reached.
2. Preserve silence as an empty result without prompting or speaking.
3. Submit non-empty recognized or caller-supplied text to the language model.
4. Optionally parse the final response and speak a non-empty parsed response.
5. Notify synchronous lifecycle callbacks without retaining their text views.

Wake-word detection, keyboard polling, image capture, continuous loops,
streaming tokens, and scheduling remain application or backend responsibilities.
Calls require external serialization and may block in injected backends.
The completed Vosk/ALSA backend feeds microphone periods incrementally and
normally returns after speech followed by recognizer-detected trailing silence;
it does not claim real-time latency. The configured listen duration remains a
safety upper bound for initial silence or speech continuing without an endpoint.

## Host build and test

```sh
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/layer1/xWalkVoiceAssistant -B build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-host -DXWALK_VOICE_ASSISTANT_BUILD_HOST_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-host --parallel
ctest --test-dir build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-host --output-on-failure
```

The suite includes both neutral coordinator coverage and a completed-backend
composition test. Every backend operation is deterministic and in memory.
Reusable callback state and functions live in
`xwalk::hal::test::voiceassistant`, outside the scenario source.

## Trace persistence and safe simulation

The host test and standalone simulation use a generated XML catalogue. A selector
such as `--trace RPI.379.enable` is saved atomically, and the next no-flag run
loads it automatically. Enabled trace records are written to both terminal and log.

```sh
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/layer1/xWalkVoiceAssistant/simulation -B build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-simulation
cmake --build build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-simulation --parallel
build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-simulation/xWalkVoiceAssistantSimulation
```

The simulation performs one full listen, model, and speech round through named
in-memory callbacks without microphone, ALSA, Ollama, provider, process, network,
filesystem-input, or audible-output access.

## Target compile check

```sh
cmake -S xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/layer1/xWalkVoiceAssistant -B build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-rpi -DXWALK_VOICE_ASSISTANT_BUILD_HARDWARE_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-rpi --parallel
ctest --test-dir build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-rpi -N -L hardware
```

The last command only lists hardware-labelled tests. It does not execute them.

The hardware-labelled composition executable requires an explicit ALSA capture
device, PCM device, mixer device, mixer element, Ollama endpoint, model, approved
prompt, and raw 16 kHz mono signed-16 little-endian response fixture. It captures
100 milliseconds, validates that microphone PCM was received, maps it to the
approved prompt, performs one non-streaming Ollama request, and plays the fixture
for the non-empty response at 15 percent volume. It prints no microphone, prompt,
model-response, fixture, or credential content.

This smoke executable deliberately uses non-physical board-control seams and
does not claim GPIO or I2C. Confirm speaker power separately through approved
deployment setup before running it:

```sh
cd build/xWalkVoiceAssistant-rpi
./xWalkVoiceAssistantHardwareTest <capture> <pcm> <mixer> <element> <endpoint> <model> <prompt> <fixture>
```

Run it only after approving microphone privacy, network policy, endpoint, model,
prompt, speaker power, devices, acoustic volume, and fixture content. Real
recognition and synthesis provider operations remain deployment-selected as
defined by `xWalkGPT`; the smoke test validates their composition boundaries.
