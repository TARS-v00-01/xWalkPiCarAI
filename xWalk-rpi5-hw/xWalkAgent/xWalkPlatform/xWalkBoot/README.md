# xWalkBoot

`xWalkBoot` owns the process-level boundary between platform hardware and Agent
coordinators. The host target supplies a device-free stub. The optional
`xWalkBootRpi` target composes the complete hardware graph used by the CLI.
Every Boot `run*` interface accepts the shared `xAgentContext` from
`xWalkLibrary/common`. Composition stages copy the context and populate
non-owning configuration, board, PiCar-X, GPIO, and I2C pointers only when the
corresponding stack-owned dependencies become available.

The shared `XWalkBoot` base owns callback validation and the one-shot lifecycle
guard. Platform implementations reuse that lifecycle instead of placing boot
state in an application controller.

The Raspberry Pi object does not claim resources during construction. Its
one-shot `run()` call loads the layered deployment configuration and delegates
to one mode-specific source file. Actuator modes
detect the Robot HAT, reset the MCU, and construct the selected motor topology;
camera-only and bounded preflight modes bypass the actuator graph. Every service remains valid
until the application callback returns.
The graph is then destroyed in reverse construction order. The automatic boot
object itself is destroyed when `main()` exits.

Boot modes are intentionally bounded:

| Mode | Services |
| --- | --- |
| `Base` | PiCar-X and its required HAL graph |
| `Doctor` | MCU-reset-only bounded preflight; no actuator or service ownership |
| `ComputerVision` | OpenCV camera provider and `XWalkComputerVision` only |
| `FaceTracking` | Base PiCar-X graph, OpenCV provider, and `XWalkFaceTracking` |
| `BullFight` | Base PiCar-X graph, OpenCV red detection, and `XWalkBullFight` |
| `TreasureHunt` | Base PiCar-X, OpenCV color detection, Pico2Wave, and spoken color game |
| `VideoRecording` | OpenCV camera and continuous AVI recording only |
| `VideoCar` | Base PiCar-X graph, OpenCV camera, and interactive driving |
| `VideoStreaming` | OpenCV camera and loopback MJPEG HTTP streaming |
| `AppControl` | Base PiCar-X, explicit WebSocket transport, camera, and sound |
| `SoundBackgroundMusic` | Shared ALSA music graph and interactive example 13 Agent |
| `LineTracking` | Base plus `XWalkLineTracking` |
| `SelfDrive` | Base plus ALSA Music and `XWalkSelfDrive` |
| `Sound` | Base plus ALSA Music |
| `VoiceChat` | Base plus Vosk, Piper, local Ollama, and VoiceAssistant |
| `VoiceActiveCar` | Base voice graph plus Music, SelfDrive, status LED, and still camera |
| `VoiceActiveCarGpt` | VoiceActiveCar graph plus the provider-neutral Jarvis profile |
| `GptCar` | VoiceActiveCar graph plus the upstream JSON GPT-car profile |
| `VoiceControlledCar` | Base plus Vosk, ALSA capture, and speech recognition |
| `VoicePromptCar` | Base plus Espeak, ALSA playback, and speaker control |
| `StorytellingRobot` | Base plus Piper WAV synthesis, playback, and speaker control |
| `TextVisionTalk` | Camera-only still capture plus local Ollama vision model |
| `OnlineLlmTest` | OpenAI-compatible HTTPS language-model provider only |
| `SpiTransfer` | Configured Linux SPI backend and SPI transfer Agent only |

The RPi graph includes device discovery, Linux I2C and GPIO, MCU reset, speaker
power, PWM, motors, servos, ADC, grayscale, ultrasonic sensing, persistent
configuration, and command-specific audio decoding or playback. Voice-active
modes additionally claim the status LED and selected still-camera backend.
Camera capture uses CSI through `rpicam-still` or a USB V4L2 webcam through
`ffmpeg`. Buzzer and user-button modules are not claimed by CLI commands.
SPI mode bypasses the base graph: it does not detect or reset the HAT and does
not claim I2C, GPIO, motors, servos, audio, camera, speech, or model resources.
Doctor mode also bypasses the base graph. It verifies the configured GPIO chip,
pulses only `hardware_mcu_reset_pin` low for 10 ms and then high, waits
`hardware_mcu_reset_settle_ms`, and may read firmware and ADC battery data. It
never constructs or moves an actuator, performs an SPI transfer, enables audio,
captures media, or contacts model services.
An explicit provisioned v4 profile passes operational verification only when no
supported v5 UUID conflicts, the exact GPIO name and label agree, reset
completes, the MCU answers at address `0x14` or `0x15`, firmware is read, and a
battery sample succeeds. This is operational agreement, not an undocumented
v4 electrical identifier. V5 and automatic selection continue to require the
supported Device Tree UUID. Safety passes only when the tracked reset completes
and no actuator, speaker, media-capture, SPI-transfer, or model operation occurs.
ComputerVision mode also bypasses the base graph and claims only the configured
camera stream. It does not inspect or reset the Robot HAT or claim motors, GPIO,
I2C, SPI, audio, speech, model, or network services.
VideoRecording mode has the same camera-only boundary and additionally owns a
local AVI writer and capture worker for the duration of the command.

ServoZeroing mode resets the Robot HAT MCU and owns PWM and Servo objects for
channels 0 through 11. It publishes only the dedicated servo-zeroing Agent and
does not construct the PiCar-X motor, sensor, or camera graph.

Deployment configuration is loaded before any Linux device is opened. Boot
uses only the configured I2C, GPIO, and Device Tree paths and never selects the
first `/dev/gpiochip*`. Optional exact kernel chip name and label values are
verified together with a minimum 28-line controller size before any GPIO line
is claimed. Automatic board selection fails before MCU reset when no supported
Robot HAT UUID is detected.

All voice modes are fully composed. Deployment values are read from the shared

The tracked voice settings use portable `default` ALSA selections, `PCM`, and

PulseAudio `Master`, and Piper executable selections only to the generated

Computer-vision and recording OpenCV source values are `v4l2`, `gstreamer`,
`video_file`, `image_sequence`, and `automatic`. Streaming intentionally has a
narrower interface: `libcamera` accepts only `csi` and constructs a fixed
GStreamer pipeline internally, while `v4l2` accepts only `/dev/videoN`.

`hardware_board` accepts `auto`, `robot_hat_v4`, or `robot_hat_v5`. The v4
value is the explicit legacy selection because the current Device Tree detector
recognizes only the v5 UUID. The v5 value requires successful v5 detection.
`auto` also requires v5 detection and never falls back to v4.

`XWalkBoardControl`, its reset GPIO, and the speaker-enable GPIO now remain
alive for the complete boot callback. This guarantees that Robot HAT speaker
power remains claimed while Espeak PCM is played through ALSA. The Vosk library,
model, microphone capture adapter, Espeak provider, selected model backend, ALSA
owner, and speech coordinators are destroyed in reverse order after the command
returns.

The dedicated `voice-chat` composition preserves example 19 with local Ollama,
Piper, and a 20-message history. The `voice-active-car` mode preserves the
Rolly profile from `example/voice_active_car.py`, uses OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`,
and reads its credential from `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Example 21's
`voice-active-car-gpt` mode defaults to credential-free local Ollama
`llama3.2:3b` and uses Piper `en_GB-alan-medium`. Gemini remains selectable
with its HTTPS endpoint and `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Supported generic provider
names are `ollama`, `openai`,
`chatgpt`, `gemini`, `grok`, `xai`, `claude`, `anthropic`, and
`openai_compatible`. Cloud
providers require HTTPS, an endpoint ending in `/chat/completions`, a model,
and a non-empty credential in the provider-configured environment variable.
Ollama requires an endpoint ending in `/api/chat` and no key.
The tracked Grok profile uses xAI's OpenAI-compatible
`https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint and reads `XAI_API_KEY` and
`XAI_MODEL` only from the deployment environment.
Legacy `voice_ollama_endpoint` and `voice_ollama_model` values remain readable
when their generic replacements are absent.

The primary controller configuration is a writable manifest. It loads
function-specific fragments and exactly one generic provider profile from
`picar-x.d/ai/providers`; the tracked default selects Ollama. Primary-file
values appearing after the includes override fragment defaults.

Kiro is rejected intentionally. Its documented command-line interface offers
non-interactive chat but no documented, model-selectable HTTP inference contract
that this embedded backend can validate. Do not map Kiro to another vendor's
wire protocol without an explicit supported API.

## Raspberry Pi compilation

Use the `xWalkAgent` or `xWalkController` aggregate RPi build. Hardware tests remain
opt-in and must only be listed during ordinary verification.
