# `XWalkTrace`

`XWalkTrace` provides filtered diagnostic output through an append-only log file
and an injected callback. It replaces implicit console logging with explicit,
testable sinks.

## Public interface

The authoritative declarations are in
[`xWalkTrace`](../../../../xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkTrace/README.md).

The application configures the active severity and supplies the callback
context. The trace object appends accepted records to
`<build-directory>/log/xWalkTrace.log`, independent of the process working
directory, and does not own the additional callback destination.
