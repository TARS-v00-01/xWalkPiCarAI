# `XWalkAdc`

`XWalkAdc` acquires raw samples from one MCU ADC channel and converts samples to
volts. The caller creates and retains the referenced `XWalkI2c` object.

## Public interface

The authoritative declaration is
[`xHal_Rpi5CarAdc.h`](../../../../xWalk-rpi5-hw/xWalkHal/device/xWalkAdc/include/xHal_Rpi5CarAdc.h).

- Construct with an I2C reference, channel, and optional device address.
- `read()` returns one raw sample assembled from exactly two bytes.
- `readVoltage()` converts the sample using the 3.3-volt reference and 4095
  maximum count.

Valid channels are 0 through 7. Backend failures and malformed response lengths
are reported through the documented exception contracts.
