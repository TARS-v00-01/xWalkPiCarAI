# Device Tree Overlay Assets Guide

`xWalk-rpi5-tool/shell-agent/env-tool/dtoverlays` contains compiled Raspberry Pi Device Tree overlay blobs
associated with SunFounder boards. They are binary boot-configuration assets, not shell scripts, runtime
libraries, or Git metadata.

## Files

| File | Intended board role |
| --- | --- |
| `sunfounder-robothat5.dtbo` | SunFounder Robot HAT 5 boot-time configuration |
| `sunfounder-servohat+.dtbo` | SunFounder Servo HAT+ boot-time configuration |

The files are kept as source-development assets. Current CMake installation rules, host CI,
`setup-rpi.sh`, and `provision-hardware.sh` do not install or activate them. The explicitly invoked
`xHal_Rpi5CarDependencyInstaller` can install only the verified Robot HAT v5 asset on its matching local hardware.

## Safety restrictions

- Physically identify the attached board before selecting an overlay.
- Do not infer Robot HAT v4 because v5 detection failed.
- Do not enable the Robot HAT 5 and Servo HAT+ overlays together.
- Inspect existing boot configuration for resource conflicts before any target change.
- Preserve the target boot configuration and keep a recoverable backup.
- Reboot only after reviewing the complete configuration change.
- Perform hardware acceptance after any overlay or kernel change.

The overlays can configure overlapping I2C, SPI, I2S, and audio resources. An incorrect selection can prevent
devices from appearing correctly and can invalidate GPIO, audio, or peripheral assumptions.

## Safe host inspection

Identify the files without installing them:

```sh
file xWalk-rpi5-tool/shell-agent/env-tool/dtoverlays/*.dtbo
sha256sum xWalk-rpi5-tool/shell-agent/env-tool/dtoverlays/*.dtbo
```

If the Device Tree compiler is installed, render a blob for review without modifying the target:

```sh
dtc -I dtb -O dts xWalk-rpi5-tool/shell-agent/env-tool/dtoverlays/sunfounder-robothat5.dtbo
```

Warnings from decompilation require review and are not evidence that an overlay is safe for the attached
board. Host inspection cannot verify electrical compatibility or runtime behavior.

## Guarded Robot HAT v5 installation

Overlay installation changes the Raspberry Pi boot configuration and requires all of the following first:

1. Physical confirmation of the exact HAT revision.
2. Review of the target Raspberry Pi model and operating-system overlay mechanism.
3. Review of existing I2C, SPI, I2S, audio, GPIO, and other overlays.
4. A recovery method for an unbootable or incorrectly configured target.
5. Explicit authorization to modify the target boot partition.

The repository does not contain a verified Robot HAT v4 overlay. `sunfounder-servohat+.dtbo` is not a Robot
HAT v4 substitute. The installer rejects v4 instead of guessing or activating the Servo HAT+ asset.

For a physically verified Robot HAT v5 whose supported UUID is already exposed locally, inspect the plan:

```sh
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/dev-tool/xHal_Rpi5CarDependencyInstaller --device rpi --profile robot_hat_v5 --required-only --dry-run
```

Apply only after reviewing the package, backup, overlay, I2C, and SPI changes:

```sh
xWalk-rpi5-tool/py-agent/dev-tool/xHal_Rpi5CarDependencyInstaller --device rpi --profile robot_hat_v5 --required-only
```

The installer verifies the source checksum, rejects its known bundled overlay conflict, preserves one
recoverable backup of an existing boot configuration and different destination blob, installs the v5 blob,
and adds only missing settings. It does not reboot or perform hardware acceptance.

After an authorized target administrator installs and selects the verified overlay, reboot the Raspberry Pi,
run the non-moving `doctor` command, inspect the expected device nodes, and complete the documented physical
hardware-acceptance procedure before any ordinary movement test.

```sh
xwalk-picarx-control --deployment-config /var/lib/xwalk/picar-x.conf doctor
```

Until Raspberry Pi and hardware-in-the-loop checks pass, treat these blobs as unverified target assets.
