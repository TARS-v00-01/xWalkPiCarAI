# Gerrit administrator request

Please provide or confirm the following without granting root access to the
Gerrit operator:

- an absolute persistent storage path owned and writable by the Gerrit service account;
- at least 10 GiB free and quota growth suitable for repositories, indexes, and backups;
- Linux ownership, restrictive permissions, directories, regular files, and file locking;
- Java 21 and commands reported missing by `gerrit-setup.sh assess`;
- the assigned VPN-facing server host or IPv4 address;
- TCP @@HTTPS_PORT@@ for HTTPS review access from the approved eduVPN subnet;
- TCP @@SSH_PORT@@ for Gerrit SSH from the approved eduVPN subnet;
- confirmation that college login SSH and Gerrit SSH are separate services;
- optional user-level systemd availability when user-service management is desired.

For the multi-repository migration, also authorize or provide:

- creation of `xWalk-Owners`, `xWalk-Partners`, and non-administrator `xWalk-CI` groups;
- creation of permission-only `xWalk-Projects`, ten component projects, and private `xWalk-rpi5-hw`;
- owner-approved `refs/meta/config` updates implementing the documented matrix;
- one-time initial `master` imports after split-history verification;
- separate individual partner and CI accounts with separate public SSH keys;
- CI `Verified -1..+1` and `xWalk-rpi5-hw` review-upload rights without administration;
- confirmation that the configured Gerrit ports are reachable from the eduVPN subnet.

The request does not include component GitHub repositories. Only the submitted
and verified configured integration branch may synchronize. During migration
this is `xWalkPiCarAI/master`; afterward it is `xWalk-rpi5-hw/master`.

Requested host: `@@SERVER_IP@@`

Requested Gerrit site: `@@GERRIT_SITE@@`

Requested endpoints: `@@CANONICAL_WEB_URL@@` and `@@SSH_LISTEN_ADDRESS@@`

No public exposure, firewall bypass, system user, system service, system
package installation, or ownership change by the installer is requested. If
shared storage is unavailable, the safe fallback is
`@@HOME@@/gerrit-site`.
